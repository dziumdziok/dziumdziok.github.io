                Hi, I'm dziumo, a cybersecurity student from Poland.
                My passion lies in both modern and vintage tech, alongside interests in cars and ThinkPads.
                Professionally, I work as a pentester and bug hunter, contributing to digital security.
                In addition to my academic pursuits, 
                I hold certifications such as Sec+, A+, Cisco Network Essential, Google Cybersecurity Certificate, and the IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate.
                In my free time, I prioritize continuous learning. 
            </p>
